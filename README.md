# CryptoCurrency App Java

  

The Cryptocurrency App in Java is a simple but powerful application that allows users to easily view the prices of four of the most popular cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and Solana. The app retrieves real-time and past data using the CoinCap API, which is a reliable and well-known source of cryptocurrency market data. It also allows users to select dates to display the graphs.
